# Echo-That-Style

This project has been converted from TypeScript (.tsx) to JavaScript (.jsx) syntax. 

## Project Status

The main application components and essential UI elements have been successfully converted to JSX format. The application should now run without needing TypeScript.

## Completed Conversions

The following critical files have been converted:
- Main application files (App.jsx, main.jsx)
- Core pages (Index.jsx, NotFound.jsx)
- Essential UI components (button.jsx, card.jsx, input.jsx, etc.)

## Remaining Conversion Tasks

Some UI components are still in TSX format. These were left as-is since they may not be immediately used in the application.

To convert the remaining TSX files as needed, you can use the provided conversion script:

```
./convert-tsx-to-jsx.sh
```

To convert a specific file:

```
./convert-tsx-to-jsx.sh path/to/file.tsx
```

## Configuration Changes

- Updated the tailwind.config.js to search for JSX files instead of TSX
- Modified package.json to use the JS version of the Vite config
- Updated import paths in JSX files to reference other JSX files

## Running the Application

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building the Application

```
npm run build
```

## Notes

- The TypeScript files have been backed up in the `backup_tsx` folder
- TypeScript type definitions for reusable components have been removed
- The application's functionality and styling should be unchanged

If you encounter any issues with specific components, you may need to manually convert additional TSX files to JSX using the provided script or by manually creating JSX versions.
